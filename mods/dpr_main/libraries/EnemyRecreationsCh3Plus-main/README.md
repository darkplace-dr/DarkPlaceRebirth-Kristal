# EnemyRecreations Ch3+
EnemyRecreations Chapter3+ is a Kristal library which recreates some of Deltarune's basic enemies.

Currently, 2 enemies are supported: Shuttah and Winglade.
## Config Options:
### Shuttah:
`use_whitelist`:  
Determines whether to use the blacklist or whitelist for the bullets that Shuttah can capture. A whitelist is better if you do not want Shuttah to capture every bullets.  
Default: `false`

`whitelist`:  
Default: `[ "shuttah/diamond_white", "shuttah/photobullet", "shuttah/waterdrop",
"winglade/batstab", "winglade/ring_afterimage", "winglade/ring" ]`

`blacklist`:  
Default: `[ "shuttah/photobullet", "shuttah/diamond_black" ]`

## Note
This library is NOT 100% accurate! (Especially Shuttah since I didn't translate its code)
